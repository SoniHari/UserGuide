<p align="center"><B>Figure: Nexcenter page</B></p>  

You can navigate the world map using the controls provided at bottom right, or with the mouse as follows:    
<ul>
<li>Zoom in and out by swiping or using the scroll wheel</li>
<li>Scroll around by holding down the left mouse button and dragging the display</li>
</ul>
## 5.1 Data Centers
The global map shows where you have active colocation services. 
<p align="center">
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Data Center Highlight Indicators</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="https://github.com/Nexcenter/NCP-Manual/blob/master/Icon-OfferingColocationServices.png"></td>
  <td>Data centers offering services.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Nexcenter/NCP-Manual/blob/master/Icon-ColocationPresence.png"></td>
    <td>Data centers where you have a colocation presence (or active colocation services).</td>
  </tr>
  </table> </p>
<p align="center"><B>Table: Data Center Indicators (Global map)</B></p>

Note: the data centers you see are determined by permissions controlled by your customer portal admins.
Select a data center as follows:

<ul>
<li>Use the drop-down list (at the top of the page): select <B>City</B> > <B>Data center</B> (listed by region)</li>, or
<li>Use the <B>Map</B>: <B>Select City</B> > <B>Data center</B></li>.
</ul>  

If selected from the drop-down list, the data center’s <B>Facility Information</B> page opens immediately (see section 5).
If selected from the map, a pop-up displays the data center’s name, description and icons to indicate the services available (see Table 6-1 for the icons shown):
<p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/Nexcenter/NCP-Manual/blob/master/Data%20Center%20Pop-up.png"> </p>

<p align="center"><B>Figure: Data center pop-up</B></p>
<ul>
<li>Click <B>View Datacenter</B> from the pop-up to open the <B>Facility Information</B> page.</li>
<li>Click an icon to open the Nexcenter page for the selected service.</li>
<li>Click <B>More Details</B> to open an external page of data center details in a new tab.</li>
<li>Click elsewhere on the map to close the pop-up.</li>
</ul>


## 5.2 Nexcenter Announcements
Nexcenter Announcements communicate the latest Nexcenter news and information, such as a description of new functionality, to all users when applicable.
An Announcements <img src="https://github.com/Nexcenter/NCP-Manual/blob/master/Announcement%20Icon.png"> icon in the header is highlighted when a new announcement is available. 

<p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/Nexcenter/NCP-Manual/blob/master/NexCenterHeader.png">
  <p align="center"><B>Figure: Nexcenter header, with Announcements icon</B></p>
  
<ul>
<li>Click the icon to open the <B>Announcements</B> page, which summarises current announcements.<Br>Select a summary to view detail of the announcement. If the detail provides a link to further information, this will open in a new browser tab.</li>
<li>Click <B>Back</B> on the details page, or use the browser’s previous page button, to return to the <B>Announcements</B> page. <Br>Exit the <B>Announcements</B> page by selecting a data center (or the world map) from the drop-down list.</Br></li>
</ul>

<h2>4.3 Nexcenter Pages</h2>
Throughout Nexcenter pages:
<ul>
<li>Dates and times shown use the time zone of the currently selected data center.</li>
<li>Links, in blue, are included in tables to help you navigate to other relevant pages – for example, you can click a Nexcenter Request  reference to open details of that Request.</li>
<li>The columns of most tables are sortable: click a column heading to sort by the contents of that column in ascending order; click the heading again to reverse the sort order.</li>
</ul>
  
### 5.3.1 Nexcenter Requests Lists

By default the lists on the Access, Delivery and Facility Request pages show up to 10 upcoming Requests of the relevant type. 
Alternatively, select to display the following:
<ul>
<li>Your requests from ‘Last 90 Days’ or ‘All’ your requests. </li>
<ul>
<li>Using the <B>Filter</B> drop-down view <B>Upcoming Requests</B>. The default view is <B>Upcoming Requests</B></li>
</ul>
<li>The list of <B>Delivery Requests</B> also has an ‘In Storage’ option, for items delivered.</li> 
<li>The list of <B>Facility Requests</B> has a ‘New’ option, for Requests posted via the Nexcenter Customer API but not yet submitted.</li>
<li>Up to 25, 50, 100 or ‘All’ requests can be viewed  that match the Filter setting, using the <B>Show</B> drop-down (10 by default). The lists are paginated, scrollable or both based on number of requests.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

## 5.4 Nexcenter Create Request Forms

Some Nexcenter form fields have colour banners that indicate if the field is mandatory, and warn if they are incomplete:
<p align="center">
 <table>
   <tr>
          <th>Banner</th>
          <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
<tr>
          <td> None</td>
          <td><B>No banner</B> <br>Completion of the field is optional.</br></td>
          </tr>
<tr>
          <td><img src="https://github.com/Nexcenter/NCP-Manual/blob/master/GreenBanner.png"></td>
           <td><B>Green</B><Br>Mandatory field, with a valid entry.</Br></td>
</tr>
       <tr>
          <td> <img src="https://github.com/Nexcenter/NCP-Manual/blob/master/RedBanner.png"></td>
        <td><B>Red</B><Br>Mandatory field, without a valid entry.</Br> Return and complete any field that displays a red banner</td>
        </tr>
  </table></p>
                                                                                                           
<p align="center"><B>Table: Nexcenter form field Indicators</B></p>

### 5.4.1 Nexcenter Request Booking Options

A number of options are available on the form while creating your Nexcenter request. The options are dependent on the request type, but may include the following:
<p align="center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Option</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
<tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Escort Required</td>
      <td>Select to indicate that <B>Remote Hands</B> assistance or an escort will be required for the attendees during their visit. A link is provided to open another tab and create the <B>Remote Hands Request</B>(see section 10.1). <Br>
Note:<ul><li>The <B>Escort Required</B> option is displayed only if available at the data<Br>center and you have the appropriate permissions.</br></li>
<li>The <B>Remote Hands </B> request must be raised when the <B>Access</B> or <br><B>Delivery</B> request is created, as the setting cannot be changed after request submission. 
</br></li>
<li>Failure to create the <B>Remote Hands</B> request when required may cause problems with your request at the data center.</br></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p align="center"><B>Table: Nexcenter Request Booking Options</B></p>

### 5.4.2 Nexcenter Selection Widget

The Nexcenter selection widget is a standard tool used to select associated items when adding or editing a <B>Nexcenter Request</B>, i.e:
<ul>
<li>The attendees and cabs for an <B>Access Request</B></li>
<li>The collectors for a <B>Delivery Request</B></li>
<li>The cabs and additional contacts for a <B>Remote Hands Request</B></li></ul>

The widget is also used to select permissions, cabs and contacts when adding or editing a permission group, and to select a cab for the download of raw power monitoring data.

#### 5.4.2.1 Select Items

To select items using the Nexcenter selection widget, either
<ul><li>Click the individual name, or </li>
  <li> Click <B>Select All</B></li></ul>
Once selected, the items move from the <B>Unselected</B> to the <B>Selected</B> list.
Optionally, type in the <B>Filter</B> field to filter the items in the <B>Unselected</B> list. On clicking   <B>Select All</B>, only the filtered items are selected. Repeat to apply multiple filters if desired.
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Nexcenter/NCP-Manual/blob/master/Filter%20and%20Select%20Item.png"></p>
  <p align="center"><B>Figure: Filter and select items</B></p>
  To remove a filter, click the ‘x’ icon on the right in the <B>Filter</B> field (displayed when a filter is applied).

Note that the <B>Unselected</B> list is scrollable if a large number of items are available for selection.

#### 5.4.2.2 De-select Items

The de-selection of items via the Nexcenter selection widget varies according to selected item type:
<ul>
<li>Click the <img src="https://github.com/Nexcenter/NCP-Manual/blob/master/Remove.png"> symbols from the selected list, </li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Nexcenter/NCP-Manual/blob/master/Deselect%20Item.png"></p>
  <p align="center"><B>Figure 4-5: Click symbols to de-select</B></p>
  Or
  <ul>
  <li>Click the items from the <B>Selected</B> list.</li>
</ul>
  <p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Nexcenter/NCP-Manual/blob/master/Deselect%20Symbol.png"></p>
  <p align="center"><B>Figure 4-6: Click Items to de-select</B></p>
  Alternatively
  
* Click <B>Unselect All.</B>
  
  Note that the <B>Selected</B> list is scrollable if a large number of items are selected.

### 5.4.3 Contacts for Nexcenter Requests

The contacts available to be assigned as attendees or collectors for a Request are those set up by your portal administrator.
Contacts are selected using the Nexcenter selection widget (see section 4.4.2).
  
---------------
 
<B>Note:</B> 
After a new user record has been created, it takes some time for them to become available for selection. Therefore you should allow up to 30 minutes from the time a new user record is created before attempting to allow it as contact for a request. <BR>If you have not allowed enough time, that user’s name will not be displayed on the form when adding a Request, and you will not be able to select them.</BR>
   
--------------
   
### 5.4.4 Guet Attendees
Where allowed by the data center, guest attendees (or guest collectors) are used for visitors who do not have a Nexcenter account. 
They can be included optionally in the following types of Nexcenter request:
 <ul><li> Access Requests (guest attendees)</li>
 <li> Delivery Requests (guest collectors)</li></ul>
 The selected guest attendees are associated with the Nexcenter request once it is submitted. Guest attendees and guest collectors are handled in the same way, so for the purposes of this section the term ‘guest attendees’ refers to both.
  
#### 5.4.4.1 Add a Guest Attendee

To add a guest attendee to a Nexcenter request,
<ol>
<li>In the <B>Request</B> form fill the guest details in the <B>Guest Attendees</B> section.</li>

    <tr>
      <th>Guest Attendee Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    </table></p>
    
  <p align="center"><B> Table: Access Request form, Guest Attendees fields</B></p>     

Guest attendee fields are displayed based on the data center requirements. Information on such requirements may be found in the data center’s <B>Facility Information</B> page or the relevant requests page in the <B>Access Request Information</B> or <B>Delivery Request Information</B> section. If guests are not permitted by the data center, the </B>Guest Attendees</B> section is not displayed in the <B>Request</B> form.   
<li>Click the <img scr="https://github.com/Nexcenter/NCP-Manual/blob/master/Plus.png"> icon to store the guest attendee and display fields for another guest attendee.</li>

## Nexcenter Permissions

Portal Administrator set your access permissions, which determine the actions available in Nexcenter.
<BR>

‘View’ permissions for a request type, for example, are required to display the appropriate Nexcenter page and to display request details, while ‘Edit’ permissions for a request type are required to create, edit or cancel a request.
</br>
